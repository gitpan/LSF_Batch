LSF::Batch - Access Platform Computing's LSF (Load Sharing Facility) Batch API

Most of the functions in the API have been implemented and work,  but
the formal test.pl is pretty skimpy. We've been using it now for
production work, so it's starting to get a workout.

If you are interested in contributing at this point, you can:

1: Write some more tests so I can get this whole thing tested.
2: Flesh out the interfaces to a few calls that I haven't implemented
   yet.
3: If you have ideas for improving the "perlishness" of the interface
   chime right in.

Notes:

This now works on both Solaris 2.X and AIX 4.3. It should also work on
Linux and Tru64.

Thanks to Jim Meyer of Platform Computing for the updated Makefile.PL.

Thanks to Ray Hookway of Compaq for the fixes to work with Tru64.

Contributions are always welcome.

History:

Version 0.01 4/04/2000:

First public release. Some functions not totally debugged and not
completely tested.

Version 0.02 4/05/2000:

Forgot to add this README to the MANIFEST. How silly of me!

Version 0.03 6/01/2000:

Got the library working on Solaris.
Fixed several bugs.

Version 0.04 4/13/2001:

Much general improvement. Added support for lsb_geteventrec. What a pain.
Wrote a script to help generate XS code from LSF include files (makexs.pl)
that at least made this task bearable.

Any suggestions, comments, questions please send to me:

Based on Version 0.04,some enhancement of APIs were added to suitable for LSF 7.0 Update 2.
All the APIs have been test in test.pl on Linux 2.6 and Solaris 10(X86_64) by perl 5.8.0.

Version 0.06 6/13/2008

Added 10 new APIs. These APIs have been tested in test.pl on linux2.6 and Solaris 10(X86_64) 
by perl 5.8.0. Added test_launch.pl to test 2 special APIs : lsb_gethostlist and lsb_launch.
You can use test.pl as normal. test_launch.pl is used in test.pl.
Added the document of the APIs. You can check it by perldoc.
